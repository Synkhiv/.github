# Pico Labs

Pico Labs is building the future of AI compute: a global network of Cloud GPUs, PCs, laptops, and mobile devices, all orchestrated by our custom engine to dynamically pool memory, optimize cache, and cost‑effectively function as a distributed data center for training and inference of state‑of‑the‑art AI models.

## Our Mission

Democratize access to high-performance AI by unlocking the untapped compute power scattered across the globe—transforming idle consumer and enterprise devices into a seamless, secure AI supercluster. We believe every researcher and startup should harness near‑infinite compute without prohibitive capital costs.

## Core Features

### Cost‑Effective Compute

Leverage underutilized GPUs and CPUs to slash training costs compared to traditional data centers or cloud providers.

### In‑Depth Training Analysis

Track job performance end‑to‑end with real‑time metrics, enabling fine‑tuning of resource allocation and hyperparameters for optimal throughput and utilization.

### Near‑Infinite Scalability

Dynamically add or remove nodes—whether NVIDIA H100s or consumer RTX cards—without downtime, scaling from a single workstation to thousands of devices in seconds.

## How It Works

1. **Custom Orchestration Engine**
   A broker coordinates node discovery and workload scheduling, ensuring each device’s memory and cache are optimally used.

2. **Secure Data Flow**
   All model shards, gradients, and intermediate activations are encrypted in transit, preserving data privacy even on public networks.

3. **Adaptive Load Balancing**
   Workloads are partitioned into DAGs, then distributed according to each node’s capabilities, balancing portability with peak performance.

## Use Cases

* **Large‑Scale Model Training**
  Pre‑train LLMs and vision models on petabyte‑scale datasets across hybrid on‑prem and cloud infrastructure.

* **Inference at the Edge**
  Distribute inference tasks to nearby devices for ultra‑low latency, powering real‑time applications like AR/VR and robotics.

* **Research & Development**
  Prototype new architectures quickly without upfront hardware procurements, democratizing experimentation.

## Getting Started

1. **Install the CLI**

   ```bash
   npm install -g @picolabs/cli
   ```

2. **Authenticate**

   ```bash
   pico login
   ```

3. **Launch a Training Job**

   ```bash
   pico train --config ./configs/llm-training.yaml
   ```

4. **Monitor & Scale**
   Use our dashboard to add or remove nodes on the fly, monitor GPU utilization, and inspect logs in real time.
